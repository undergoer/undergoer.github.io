<h2>MHFA Chat Tool with ALGEE Assessment</h2>

<p>
This is the "Get help" guide for the <a href="https://didactic.mdhs.unimelb.edu.au">MHFA chatbot</a>.
</p>

<p>
Once the page has loaded you will get the app that looks like the image below with the 3 annotations below.

<ul>
  <li>red circle: you can restart by reloading the page by clicking this circular arrow</li>
  <li>yellow ellipse: you can get back to this help page by clicking on these 3 vertical dots and selecting "Get help"</li>
  <li>green box: you can assess your interaction with the chatbot by clicking on the "ALGEE Assess" button inside this box</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>3 Case Studies</h3>

<p>There are 3 case studies on this website:
  <ul>
  <li>Jake,
  <li>Laura, and
  <li>Sarah
</ul>

They all have different scenarios. They are loaded randomly. If you don't like the scenario you're given, you can reload the page (see red circle above).
</p>

<h3>This is a trial</h3>
<p>Be patient with the system please. Sometimes "thinking" can take up to 20 seconds, but we figure that's faster than your tutor marking your MHFA interaction!</p>

<p>This is not a commercial system. We want to be able to give you a chance to practice the MHFA skills you are learning in class. As such, things can get messed up or take about 10 seconds to load.</p> 

<p>For example, the chatbot can get a little mixed up. Just gently nudge it back if so as seen below.</p>
