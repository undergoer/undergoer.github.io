<h2>MHFA Chat Tool with ALGEE Assessment</h2>

This is the "Get help" guide for the <a href="https://didactic.mdhs.unimelb.edu.au">MHFA chatbot</a>.
</p>

<p>
Once the page has loaded you will get the app that looks like the image below with the 3 annotations below.

<ul>
  <li>red circle: you can restart by reloading the page by clicking this circular arrow</li>
  <li>yellow ellipse: you can get back to this help page by clicking on these 3 vertical dots and selecting "Get help"</li>
  <li>green box: you can assess your interaction with the chatbot by clicking on the "ALGEE Assess" button inside this box</li>
</ul>

<h3>This is a trial</h3>

<p>This is not a commercial system. We want to be able to give you a chance to practice the MHFA skills you are learning in class. As such, things can get messed up or take about 10 seconds to load. Be patient with the sysstem please.</p>
<p>For example, the chatbot can get a little mixed up. Just gently nudge it back if so as seen below.</p>
